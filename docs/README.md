# GIPHY Viewer
GIPHY Viewer is an Android application that displays various GIFs based on the userâ€™s search requests. This is accomplished by consuming the Search API provided by GIPHY. For its implementation, React Native was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, its hybrid nature could be useful in the future should the application be ported to iOS. Secondly, React Native is part of a rapidly-growing ecosystem of programming resources, and it was thus chosen over the other options.
